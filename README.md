# CS61A-Fall-2019
taken with Daddy Denero 
the repository is finalized and won't be updated 

The repository contains my code for 61A Fall 2019 semester, including all the homework, labs and projects.

Please use it reasonably for reference if you need. 61A may be intimidating for beginners (including me) and I see the necessity sometimes to get inspired by other people's approach and ideas in order to come up with your own methods, which is totally understandable. Hope you can figure out and resolve your glitch(s) soon!

Copying others' code may subject to academic dishonesty :( and I don't recommend you doing that. Completing an assignment is not all the point of this class. Understanding and really mastering the concepts are really what your goal should be. 61A is really an excellent introductary class and so far one of the best class I've taken at Cal. Don't cheat. Slow down and enumerate through. You will get it. 

My code is not perfect. There are a lot of redundacys, style, and structure that I could improve. Hope you can bear with that. It is probably a representation of an average 61A student's work.

It is a hard class like other cs classes at Cal, but you get it! so heads up and keep going :)
